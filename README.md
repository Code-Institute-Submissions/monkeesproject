#Title: Monkees Project

I have created a four page mobile responsive website that showcases the bands music, images and availability.
I was asked to create a website that contained information about the band, to include audio clips and images.
In response to this I have created a hompeage that gives information about the band, an image gallery which contains images of the band and their albumn covers. 
I created a music library which contains a video clip of the band and also contains a track list with audio clips. I also created a booking page with a form for potential clients to leave their information for booking the band for occasions.

##UX
I thought about what the band wanted to showcase and provide for potential clients, I then went about design a crisp, easy to navigate site that provide the user with a good experience.

1. As a potential client, I want to find out about the band, so I can decide if i want to book them.
2. As a potential client, I want to listen to the music, to decide if i like it.
3. As the band, we want our music and information clearly accessible, to sell our product.


##Features
Navbar- For easy navigation of the website, takes the user to where they want to be.
Image gallery- Shows the images the band wants the client to see.
Music Library- Users can view and listen to the bands music.
Booking Form- Provides the user with a way to contact the band regarding booking.
Social links- Provides the user with another means of connecting with the band and viewing additional content.

##Technologies Used 
Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/ Used for styling and layout of the webpage.
jQuery and Javascript  https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js Used for functionality of bootstrap navbar.

##Testing

###1. Navbar:
       * Checked all links were working.
       * Changed screen size to mobile size and navbar changes to dropdown.
       * Dropdown menu didn't work as I had not included jQuery or javascript.
       *  After adding them to document dropdown menu works perfectly when in small screen.

###2. Music Library:
      * Inserted all audio and media files.
      * Checked all files played.
      * Changed screen size to see how the files stacked.

###3. Booking Form:
      *  Booking form page.
      *  Tried to submit form without email address.
      *  Form will not submit until the required fields are completed.
