Title: Monkees Project

I have created a four page mobile responsive website that showcases the bands music, images and availability.
I was asked to create a website that contained information about the band, to include audio clips and images.
In response to this I have created a hompeage that gives information about the band, an image gallery which contains images of the band and their albumn covers. 
I created a music library which contains a video clip of the band and also contains a track list with audio clips. I also created a booking page with a form for potential clients to leave their information for booking the band for occasions.

UX
I thought about what the band wanted to showcase and provide for potential clients, I then went about design a crisp, easy to navigate site that provide the user with a good experience.

1. As a potential client, I want to find out about the band, so I can decide if i want to book them.
2. As a potential client, I want to listen to the music, to decide if i like it.
3. As the band, we want our music and information clearly accessible, to sell our product.
